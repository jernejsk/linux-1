## Transmit throughput

**The earlier "transmit is credit-limited at 14.6 MB/s" conclusion in this file
was an artefact of the measurement, not a property of the device.** Uploads were
measured with `curl -T` against a Python `http.server`, and that receiver caps a
single connection at about 15 MB/s. Against `iperf3` over the same link, same
driver, same firmware, transmit does **30 MB/s**.

The credit arithmetic that appeared to confirm the 14.6 MB/s ceiling was
circular. One credit is spent per packet, so credits per second multiplied by
packet size always reproduces the measured throughput, whatever the throughput
happens to be. It cannot distinguish a credit limit from any other limit.

Real numbers, 5 GHz VHT80 one stream, MCS 9, SDR104 at 150 MHz:

| | throughput | CPU (4 cores) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| upload, 1 stream | 30.6 MB/s | 19% |
| upload, 4 streams | 31.7 MB/s | |
| download, 1 stream | 40.5 MB/s | |
| bidirectional | 20.3 up + 20.0 down | |

One stream reaches within 4% of four streams, so nothing per-flow is throttling
transmission.

### What the transmit rate actually depends on

How much the driver packs into one CMD53, measured over ten seconds each:

| blocks | throughput | queue stopped |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | 22.7 MB/s | 1.3% |
| 16 | 26.6 MB/s | 2.0% |
| 32 | 30.9 MB/s | 5.8% |
| 48 | 31.9 MB/s | 9.6% |
| 64 | 31.7 MB/s | 12.1% |

The knee is at 48 blocks, now the default. This is the same experiment that
looked like it changed nothing when the Python receiver was setting the pace.

### Ruled out, with numbers

- **Per-flow queue limits.** `sk_pacing_shift` 10, 8, 7 and 6 all give 30-32
  MB/s. TCP small queues are not involved, so the mac80211 pacing-shift trick
  buys nothing here and was dropped.
- **Reordering.** `ss -ti` shows `reord_seen:566` on a loaded flow, but
  `tcp_reordering` 3 versus 127 changes nothing (15.6 versus 15.4 MB/s on the
  old harness), and retransmits at full speed are 30 of 21,000 segments.
- **A-MSDU.** Setting `amsdu_permit` in our own ADDBA request leaves frame size
  at 1508 B. The firmware does not aggregate MSDUs on transmit. Reverted.
- **Pinning a flow to one credit pool.** Do not do this: the controller
  replenishes the pools it chooses, not the one being drained. Colour 0 hit zero
  while 1, 2 and 3 sat at 19, and since the queue is only woken by a grant,
  transmit deadlocked. The fallback to unclaimed pools is load-bearing.

### Where the remaining gap is

Transmit 30 MB/s against receive 40 MB/s on a 54 MB/s PHY. The queue is stopped
9.6% of the time at 48 blocks, and grants arrive in lumps of 9 to 16 credits
because the firmware reposts buffers only once eight have accumulated
(`0x0013A968`, see `firmware-re/65-tx-flow-control.md`). Lowering that threshold
is worth at most the stopped fraction, and only if the MAC can drain while the
host waits. The rest of the gap is air-side asymmetry between what this radio
transmits and what the access point transmits.

### Measurement rule

Never measure a link with a userspace sink in the path. Use `iperf3`, and bind
it to the interface with `-B <addr>%<dev>` - binding the address alone routes
over Ethernet and reports 110 MB/s of gigabit link.
